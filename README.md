# Econ 104 Data Science for Economics Projects
## By Krish Methi

* This repository contains a collection of the projects I worked on for Economics 104, Data Science for Economics in the Winter of 2024. 

* This course covered topics such as Heteroskedasticity, Multivariate Regression, Instrumental Variables, Panel Data and Binary and Dependent Models, and Regularization.

* There are three projects I worked on using R. The first project dealt with taking a dataset and using different methods to create the best regression model. The second project dealt with fitting the best model to a time series dataset. The third project dealt with fitting models to Panel Data and Binary/Dependent data.

* We found our own datasets to use for these projects.

* Each project will be detailed further in their own respective folders.
