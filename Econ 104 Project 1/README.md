# Project 1

**Description:** In this project, the dataset we used was the Boston Housing Dataset. We used multiple regressors to predict house prices. After giving a description of each variable, we first fit a multiple regression model to the data after cleaning the dataset for outliers. We then used Mallows CP and the Boruta Algorith to further subset the variables we used in our model. Lastly, we tested our model for heteroskedasticity and used cross validation to pick our optimal model. 

I have added the Rmarkdown source code and the PDF file.
