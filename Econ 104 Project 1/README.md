# Project 1

**Description:** In this project, the dataset we used was the Boston Housing Dataset. The dependent variable we used was house price with the rest of the variables as predictors. After giving a description of each variable, we first fit a multiple regression model to the data after cleaning the dataset for outliers. We then used Mallows CP and the Boruta Algorith to further subset the variables in our model. Lastly, we tested our model for heteroskedasticity and used cross validation to pick our optimal model.
