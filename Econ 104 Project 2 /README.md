# Project 2

**Description:** In this project, we fit multiple models to a time series dataset in order to find the best fit. The dataset we used was the USMacroG dataset of 12 Macroeconomic variables, and we filtered the set to 5 specific variables. We aimed to predict GDP and consumption growth based on the other three variables.
